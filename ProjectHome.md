This project is to create a simple java app to export Voicemail and SMS from any jailbroken iOS(iPhone) device.  This is needed to archive these items, as most wireless carriers do not have facilities for doing this.  Mainly creating for personal use, but if helps others that is great as well.  May port to C later so that it can be merged with libimobiledevice (If that turns out to be worthwhile).

Please note:
This is currently a sloppy, work progress, alpha'ish code base.  I just started working on it and it may take a while before it is coherent.   Avoid using until I say otherwise.
